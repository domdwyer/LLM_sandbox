### Glossary

#### Notebook
- **Definition**: A Jupyter notebook (`.ipynb` file) is an interactive document that contains both code and rich text elements (paragraphs, equations, figures, links, etc.). It allows you to run code in a step-by-step manner and see the output immediately.
- **Usage**: Commonly used for data analysis, machine learning, and scientific computing. It is ideal for exploratory data analysis and sharing results with others.
- **Features**:
  - Interactive code execution.
  - Inline visualization of data.
  - Markdown support for documentation.
  - Ability to mix code and text.

#### Workspace
- **Definition**: A workspace in Visual Studio Code is a collection of one or more folders that you are working on. It includes project files, settings, and configurations.
- **Usage**: Helps organize and manage your project files and settings in one place. It can include multiple projects and their configurations.
- **Features**:
  - Project-specific settings and configurations.
  - Support for multiple folders.
  - Integration with version control systems like Git.
  - Extensions and customizations specific to the workspace.

#### Virtual Environment
- **Definition**: An isolated Python environment that has its own installation directories, dependencies, and packages.
- **Purpose**: Ensures that your project dependencies are isolated from other projects and the global Python installation, preventing conflicts between package versions.
- **Usage**: Commonly created using tools like `venv` or `virtualenv`.

#### Jupyter Extension
- **Definition**: An extension for Visual Studio Code that provides support for Jupyter notebooks.
- **Usage**: Allows you to create, open, and run Jupyter notebooks directly within Visual Studio Code.

#### PyTorch
- **Definition**: An open-source machine learning library based on the Torch library, used for applications such as computer vision and natural language processing.
- **Usage**: Popular in the research community for its ease of use and flexibility, especially for developing and prototyping deep learning models.

#### TensorFlow
- **Definition**: An open-source machine learning library developed by Google, used for a wide range of machine learning and deep learning applications.
- **Usage**: Widely used in production environments, with strong support for deployment and an extensive ecosystem.

#### `requirements.txt`
- **Definition**: A file used to list all the packages and their versions that your project depends on.
- **Usage**: Helps keep track of project dependencies and allows others to replicate your environment easily.
- **Example**:
  ```plaintext
  tensorflow==2.0.0
  transformers
  ```

#### `pip`
- **Definition**: The package installer for Python, used to install and manage Python packages.
- **Usage**: Commonly used to install packages from the Python Package Index (PyPI).
- **Example**:
  ```bash
  pip install tensorflow
  ```

#### `pip freeze`
- **Definition**: A command that outputs a list of installed packages in the current environment, along with their versions.
- **Usage**: Often used to generate a `requirements.txt` file.
- **Example**:
  ```bash
  pip freeze > requirements.txt
  ```

#### `source`
- **Definition**: A command used to execute commands from a file in the current shell.
- **Usage**: Commonly used to activate a virtual environment on macOS/Linux.
- **Example**:
  ```bash
  source env/bin/activate
  ```

#### `activate`
- **Definition**: A script used to activate a virtual environment.
- **Usage**: Activates the virtual environment, setting up the environment variables and paths.
- **Example**:
  - On macOS/Linux:
    ```bash
    source env/bin/activate
    ```
  - On Windows:
    ```bash
    .\env\Scripts\activate
    ```
